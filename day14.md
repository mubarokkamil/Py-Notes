# Day-14: If-Else-Conditionals

## if-else Statements:
Sometimes the programmer needs to check the evaluation of certain expression(s), whether the expression(s) evaluate to True or False. If the expression evaluates to False, then the program execution follows a different path than it would have if the expression had evaluated to True.

Based on this, the conditional statements are further classified into following types:
- if
- if-else
- if-elif-else
- nested if-else-elif.
